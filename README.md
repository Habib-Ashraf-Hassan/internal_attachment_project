# Madrassah Management System
The Madrassah Management System is a comprehensive web application developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap CSS framework. It serves as an efficient tool for the administrators, teachers, registrars, and students of an Islamic learning institute (Madrassah). This system automates various tasks that were previously done manually, such as grading students, registering new students and teachers, and streamlining administrative operations.

## Key features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: The system provides different user roles, including administrators, teachers, registrars, and students. Each role has specific functionalities and permissions tailored to their responsibilities.

- **Student Management**: The system enables the efficient management of student information, including registration, enrollment, and tracking academic performance. Teachers can easily grade students and record their progress.

- **Teacher Management**: Administrators and registrars can add and manage teacher profiles, assigning them to specific subjects and classes. Teachers can access their respective courses and record grades for their assigned students.

- **Registration and Enrollment**: Registrars can register new students, assign them to appropriate classes, and manage the enrollment process. The system keeps track of student records and allows for easy updates and transfers.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web application features a clean and intuitive interface built with HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. This ensures a user-friendly experience for all users, regardless of their technical expertise.
